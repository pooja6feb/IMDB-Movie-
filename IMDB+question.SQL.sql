-- Segment 1:

ALTER TABLE movie
CHANGE COLUMN year year_released INT;

alter table names 
rename column name to a_name;


-- Q1. Find the total number of rows in each table of the schema?
-- Type your code below:
select count(*) as director_mapping_rows from director_mapping;
select count(*) as genre_rows from genre;
select count(*) as movie_rows from movie;
select count(*) as names_rows from names;
select count(*) as ratings_rows from ratings;
select count(*) as role_mapping_rows from role_mapping;

-- Q2. Which columns in the movie table have null values?
-- Type your code below:
select count(*) from movie where id is null;
select count(*) from movie where title is null;
select count(*) from movie where year_released is null;
select count(*) from movie where  date_published is null;
select count(*) from movie where duration is null;
select count(*) from movie where country is null;
select count(*) from movie where worlwide_gross_income is null;
select count(*) from movie where languages is null;
select count(*) from movie where production_company is null;





-- Now as you can see four columns of the movie table has null values. Let's look at the at the movies released each year.
